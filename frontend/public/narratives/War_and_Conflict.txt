## **1. France**

* In the **early 18th century**, France experienced a **gradual decline** in war-related themes, reaching a **peak value of 0.697 in 1843** (Figure 1).

  * This coincided with the **Regency period**, which followed the death of **Louis XIV** and marked the **end of absolute monarchy** and a move toward **liberalism**.

* The **French Revolution (1789–1799)** brought a **surge in war-themed poetry**:

  * Poets such as *Lamartine* and *Victor Hugo* engaged with the **conflict, upheaval**, and **transformative ideals** of the Revolution.

* During the **Napoleonic Era (1799–1815)**:

  * There was a **slight decline** in war-related poetry, though **patriotic sentiment** remained strong.

* Under the **Restoration of the Bourbon monarchy (1815–1848)**:

  * A resurgence of **nationalism** and **patriotism** led to a **peak value of 0.706 in 1848**, corresponding with the **Revolution of 1848** and the birth of the **Second Republic**.

* The **Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871)**:

  * Had a **devastating impact** on France, resulting in the **collapse of the Second Empire** and the **establishment of the Third Republic**.
  * War-related poetry **peaked at 0.8 in 1870** (Figure 2), but soon **declined sharply**.
  * The **rise of realism**, **naturalism**, and **secularization debates** in the late 1800s further **shifted poetic focus** away from war.

## **2. Germany**

* In **late 18th-century Germany**, war-themed poetry grew in response to:

  * **Enlightenment ideals**, **early Romanticism**, and the **dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806**.

* The **Revolutions of 1848**:

  * Brought a **renewed surge** in war-related poetry, reflecting aspirations for **national unity** and **political reform**.

* The **Wars of German Unification (1864–1871)**:

  * Sparked an **intensification** of patriotic and military themes, with a **peak value of 0.844 in 1861** (Figure 3).
  * Poets addressed themes of **unity**, **identity**, and **national destiny**.

* In the **late 19th century**, **nationalism**, **industrialization**, and **cultural modernism** rose:

  * These developments led to a **decline in overtly war-themed poetry**, as **modernist and social issues** gained prominence.

---

## **3. Cross-National Influence**

* **Shared revolutions** and **parallel political shifts** fostered **similar poetic responses**:

  * The **Revolutions of 1848** in both France and Germany were marked by **increases in war-themed poetry**, reflecting widespread **social unrest** and **nationalist ambition**.

* The **Franco-Prussian War** had an **asymmetric impact**:

  * While it fueled **nationalist fervor** in Germany, it precipitated a **significant poetic and cultural decline in France**.

## **Conclusion**

The theme of **"War and Conflict"** in **French and German poetry** during the **1700s and 1800s** reflects the deep entanglement of **literature with political history**:

* **Realism**, **naturalism**, and **secularization** shifted focus away from traditional heroic portrayals of war toward more **socially grounded and reflective themes**.
