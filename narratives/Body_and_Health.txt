As we delve into the historical development of the poetry theme "Body and Health" in France and Germany from 1843 to 1899, it becomes apparent that this topic underwent significant changes in both countries. This analysis will explore periods of growth or decline, diverging trends between France and Germany, and connections to major historical events.

**Early Years (1843-1855):**
The theme "Body and Health" experienced a steady decline in both France and Germany during the early years. The data shows a gradual decrease in thematic prevalence from 0.405 in 1843 to 0.221 in 1854, indicating a waning interest in this topic. This period coincides with the aftermath of the French Revolution (1789-1799) and the rise of Romanticism in both countries. The focus on individualism, emotional expression, and the sublime may have contributed to a shift away from themes related to physical health.

**Mid-Century (1855-1867):**
In France, there is a noticeable increase in thematic prevalence around 1856, coinciding with the establishment of Napoleon III's Second Empire. The data suggests that this period saw an uptick in poetry exploring the human body and health. This might be attributed to the influence of realism and naturalism in French literature, which often emphasized the importance of physical experience and the everyday life.

In Germany, the theme "Body and Health" experiences a similar increase around 1865, coinciding with the rise of nationalism and cultural modernism. The unification of Germany under Prussian leadership (1871) may have contributed to an increased focus on the human body and health as a means of promoting national identity and the physical fitness required for industrialization.

** Late Nineteenth Century (1868-1899):**
The latter half of the century sees a decline in thematic prevalence in both countries. The data indicates a steady decrease from 0.262 in 1868 to 0.247 in 1899, suggesting that poetry began to focus on other themes.

In France, this period coincides with the rise of Symbolism and the emergence of avant-garde movements, which may have led to a shift away from traditional themes like "Body and Health." The Dreyfus Affair (1894) and secularization debates further contributed to a cultural climate that emphasized intellectual and philosophical pursuits over physical health.

In Germany, the decline in thematic prevalence might be attributed to the country's rapid industrialization, urbanization, and military expansion. The focus on nationalism, colonialism, and militarism may have led poets to explore other themes, such as patriotism, identity, and the human cost of war.

**Cross-National Influence:**
While there is no direct evidence of a significant German influence on French poetry or vice versa, both countries shared similar cultural and intellectual currents during this period. The rise of realism, naturalism, and Symbolism in France may have influenced literary trends in Germany, where these movements also emerged. Similarly, the unification of Germany under Prussian leadership might have inspired poets in France to explore themes related to national identity and physical health.

**Conclusion:**
The theme "Body and Health" underwent significant changes in both France and Germany from 1843 to 1899. The data reveals a decline in thematic prevalence during the early years, followed by an increase in mid-century coinciding with the rise of realism, naturalism, and nationalism. The latter half of the century saw a decline in thematic prevalence, attributed to cultural shifts towards intellectual pursuits, industrialization, urbanization, and militarism. While there is no direct cross-national influence evident, both countries shared similar literary and cultural currents during this period.
