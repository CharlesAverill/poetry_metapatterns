The evolution of the theme "Complexity and Paradox" in France and Germany reveals a complex interplay between historical events, cultural movements, and poetic trends. As we delve into the data, several key periods emerge that shed light on how these two nations approached this theme.

**Early 18th century: The French Regency period**
In France, the death of Louis XIV in 1715 marked the beginning of the Regency period, a time of relative stability and cultural flourishing. During this era, French poetry began to explore complexity and paradox through the works of poets like Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux and Jean-Baptiste Rousseau. This early emphasis on rational inquiry and philosophical nuance set the stage for future poetic developments.

**Late 18th century: The German Enlightenment**
In Germany, the reign of Frederick the Great (1740–1786) saw the rise of the Enlightenment, which emphasized reason, individualism, and intellectual curiosity. This cultural movement influenced German poetry, with writers like Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Friedrich von Schiller exploring complexity and paradox in their works. The German Sturm und Drang movement, characterized by intense emotional expression and a focus on the human condition, also emerged during this period.

**Revolutionary era: 1789–1799**
The French Revolution's impact on poetry was profound. As France's traditional social hierarchies were overturned, poets like Maximilien Robespierre and André Chénier addressed the complexities of revolutionary politics and the human experience. In Germany, the late 18th century saw the rise of early Romanticism, with writers like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller exploring themes of individuality, nature, and the sublime.

**Napoleonic Era: 1799–1815**
During Napoleon's rule, French poetry became more formalized and ornate, reflecting the Emperor's grandiose ambitions. Poets like Victor Hugo and Alphonse de Lamartine explored the complexities of power, morality, and the human condition in their works.

**19th century: Realism and naturalism**
In the mid-19th century, French poetry shifted towards realism and naturalism, as seen in the works of Charles Baudelaire and Gustave Flaubert. This trend was influenced by the rise of industrialization, urbanization, and secularization debates. German poetry during this period saw the emergence of poets like Heinrich Heine and Gottfried Keller, who explored themes of individuality, social change, and cultural heritage.

**Late 19th century: Decline and resurgence**
The late 19th century witnessed a decline in French poetic focus on complexity and paradox, as the country's literary scene became more fragmented and avant-garde. However, this period also saw the rise of Symbolist poetry, which would later influence the development of modernist and surrealist movements.

**Early 20th century: World War I and beyond**
The trauma of World War I led to a resurgence of interest in complexity and paradox in French poetry, as seen in the works of poets like Guillaume Apollinaire, Blaise Cendrars, and André Breton. German poetry during this period saw the emergence of Expressionist and Dadaist movements, which emphasized experimentation, chaos, and the exploration of the human condition.

In conclusion, the theme of complexity and paradox in French and German poetry reflects the complex interplay between historical events, cultural movements, and poetic trends. While there are periods of growth and decline, as well as diverging trends between the two nations, the overall narrative reveals a deepening engagement with this theme over time. The impact of wars, revolutions, and cultural shifts on poetic development is evident throughout, highlighting the dynamic and ever-changing nature of literary expression.
