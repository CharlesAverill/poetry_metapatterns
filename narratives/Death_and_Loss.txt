The theme of "Death and Loss" in French and German poetry underwent significant changes throughout the 1700s and 1800s. This narrative will explore the evolution of this theme, highlighting key historical events, cultural shifts, and poetic trends that influenced its development.

**Early 18th century (1715-1740)**
The death of Louis XIV in France marked a transition to the Regency period, which saw the rise of Enlightenment values. French poetry during this era, such as that of Voltaire and Rousseau, focused on philosophical themes like mortality and the fleeting nature of human existence. German literature, influenced by Frederick the Great's reign (1740-1786), saw the emergence of Sturm und Drang and early Romanticism, which explored themes of despair, melancholy, and the human condition.

**Late 18th century (1789-1815)**
The French Revolution brought about a seismic shift in both countries. In France, the Reign of Terror (1793-1794) saw the execution of King Louis XVI, leading to an intense focus on mortality, loss, and the transience of human life. German literature, influenced by the Enlightenment and the rise of nationalism, explored themes of freedom, equality, and the human cost of war.

**Early 19th century (1815-1848)**
The Congress of Vienna (1815) led to the formation of the German Confederation, while France entered a period of Restoration under the Bourbon monarchy. This era saw a decline in the theme's prevalence in both countries, as poetry focused on more optimistic themes like national identity and cultural heritage.

**Mid-19th century (1848-1870)**
The Revolutions of 1848 shook Europe, leading to significant changes in both France and Germany. In France, the February Revolution (1848) saw the fall of the monarchy, while Germany experienced a wave of revolutions that ultimately led to unification under Prussian leadership. Poetry during this period focused on themes of social justice, equality, and the struggle for human rights.

**Late 19th century (1871-1890s)**
The Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) marked a turning point in both countries. The defeat of France led to a decline in the theme's prevalence, as poetry focused on more optimistic themes like industrialization and cultural modernism. In Germany, the unification process led to an increased focus on national identity, while French poetry continued to explore themes of loss, mortality, and the human condition.

**Cross-national influence**
Throughout this period, there was a significant exchange of ideas between France and Germany. The German Romantic movement influenced French literature, particularly in the work of poets like Alfred de Musset and Th√©ophile Gautier. Conversely, French Realism had an impact on German literature, with writers like Gottfried Keller and Thomas Mann drawing inspiration from the French literary tradition.

**Conclusion**
The theme of "Death and Loss" in French and German poetry underwent significant changes throughout the 1700s and 1800s. Political upheavals, cultural shifts, and intellectual currents all played a role in shaping this evolution. While there were periods of growth and decline, the theme remained an important part of both literary traditions, reflecting the complexities and challenges of human experience.

By examining the historical context and poetic trends in France and Germany during this period, we gain insight into the ways in which literature reflects and shapes cultural attitudes towards mortality, loss, and the human condition.
