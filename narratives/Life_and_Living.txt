The theme of "Life and Living" in France and Germany underwent significant transformations across the 1700s and 1800s. This narrative will explore the key changes, diverging trends, and connections to major historical events that shaped the poetic focus on this theme.

**Early 1700s: French Sturm und Drang**
The early 1700s saw a surge in French poetry focused on "Life and Living." This period, marked by the Regency of Philip II (1715), witnessed an increase in literary experimentation. Poets like Antoine Houdar de La Motte and Jean-Antoine de Baïf explored themes of nature, morality, and human existence. This Sturm und Drang-like movement laid the groundwork for later Romanticism.

** Late 1700s: French Enlightenment**
As the French Enlightenment took hold, poetry shifted towards a focus on reason, science, and social commentary. Poets like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau critiqued societal norms and explored human nature through their works. This period saw a decline in "Life and Living" themes, as writers prioritized intellectual pursuits.

**1800s: French Revolution and Romanticism**
The French Revolution's impact on poetry was profound. Writers like Victor Hugo and Alfred de Musset turned to Romanticism, exploring themes of freedom, passion, and the human condition. The rise of constitutional monarchy (1830) and the establishment of the Second Republic (1848) further solidified this focus.

**German Romanticism**
In Germany, the late 1700s saw an early Romantic movement led by figures like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. This period was marked by a focus on nature, mythology, and the human experience. The Congress of Vienna (1815), which formed the German Confederation, contributed to a growing sense of national identity.

**1848: Revolutions in France and Germany**
The year 1848 saw simultaneous revolutions in both countries. In France, the February Revolution led to the establishment of the Second Republic, while in Germany, the March Revolution sparked unification efforts. Poetry responded to these upheavals by exploring themes of freedom, democracy, and national identity.

**Late 1800s: Realism and Naturalism**
As industrialization and urbanization accelerated, French poetry shifted towards Realism and Naturalism (late 1800s). Writers like Émile Zola and Gustave Flaubert focused on the human condition, exploring social issues and everyday life. In Germany, writers like Theodor Fontane and Gottfried Keller continued to explore themes of national identity and social commentary.

**Cross-National Influence**
While not explicitly evident in the data, it is likely that French Romanticism influenced German literature, and vice versa. For example, the works of Victor Hugo may have inspired German Romantics like Goethe and Schiller.

In conclusion, the theme "Life and Living" underwent significant transformations in France and Germany across the 1700s and 1800s. Key historical events, such as revolutions, wars, and cultural movements, contributed to changes in poetic focus on this theme. While there were diverging trends between the two countries, cross-national influence is likely to have played a role in shaping their respective literary developments.
