The theme of "Morality and Ethics" in French and German poetry underwent significant changes throughout the 1700s and 1800s. This analysis will explore the key shifts, periods of growth and decline, diverging trends between France and Germany, and connections to major historical events.

**France**

The early 1700s saw a decline in the theme's prevalence, likely due to the relative stability under the Regency period (1715-1723) following Louis XIV's death. As the French Enlightenment gained momentum, moral and ethical concerns began to resurface in poetry during the late 1700s. This was particularly evident in the works of Voltaire, Rousseau, and other influential thinkers.

The French Revolution (1789-1799) marked a significant turning point. Poets like André Chénier and Guillaume-Guillaume Alexandre emphasized the importance of moral responsibility and civic duty in their works, reflecting the revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The Napoleonic Era (1799-1815) saw a slight decline in thematic focus on morality, as Napoleon's imperial ambitions overshadowed philosophical debates.

The July Revolution of 1830 brought constitutional monarchy to France, and with it, a renewed interest in moral and ethical themes. Poets like Alfred de Musset and Victor Hugo explored the tension between individual freedom and social responsibility. The French Revolution of 1848 led to a brief period of increased focus on morality, as poets grappled with the implications of political upheaval on personal and societal ethics.

The late 1800s saw a decline in thematic emphasis on morality, coinciding with the rise of realism and naturalism in literature. However, the Dreyfus Affair (1894-1906) and secularization debates sparked renewed discussions about moral responsibility and ethical accountability in poetry.

**Germany**

In Germany, the late 1700s saw a surge in interest in morality and ethics, influenced by the Enlightenment and Sturm und Drang movements. Poets like Goethe and Schiller explored themes of individual responsibility, social justice, and the human condition.

The Congress of Vienna (1815) led to the formation of the German Confederation, which had a stabilizing effect on German poetry's thematic focus on morality. The Revolutions of 1848 in Germany saw a brief increase in emphasis on moral and ethical concerns, as poets reacted to the tumultuous political landscape.

The Wars of German unification (1864-1871) brought about a decline in thematic focus on morality, as nationalism and militarism dominated the cultural discourse. However, the establishment of the German Empire under Prussian leadership led to a renewed interest in moral and ethical themes, particularly among poets who emphasized the importance of civic duty and national responsibility.

The late 1800s saw a rise in nationalist sentiment, industrialization, and cultural modernism, which may have contributed to a decline in thematic focus on morality. Nevertheless, German poetry continued to grapple with questions of individual freedom, social justice, and ethical accountability.

**Cross-National Influence**

While there is no direct evidence of a significant impact of French trends on German poetry or vice versa, it is possible that cross-cultural exchange influenced the development of moral and ethical themes in both countries. The Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and individual rights, for example, had a profound impact on both French and German literature.

In conclusion, the theme of "Morality and Ethics" in French and German poetry underwent significant changes throughout the 1700s and 1800s. Both countries experienced periods of growth and decline, influenced by major historical events, cultural movements, and intellectual shifts. While there were no direct cross-cultural influences, the broader cultural and philosophical currents that shaped European literature likely had an indirect impact on the development of moral and ethical themes in both France and Germany.
