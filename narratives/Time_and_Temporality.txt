The theme of "Time and Temporality" in French and German poetry underwent significant transformations across the 1700s and 1800s. This narrative will explore the key changes, periods of growth or decline, diverging trends between France and Germany, and connections to major historical, social, or cultural events.

**Early 18th Century: Stabilization and Enlightenment (France)**

In the early 1700s, French poetry focused on classical themes, with a growing emphasis on rationality and order. The death of Louis XIV in 1715 marked the beginning of the Regency period, which saw a relative calm in politics and society. This stability allowed poets like Jean de La Fontaine to flourish, exploring themes of time, morality, and human nature within the framework of classical learning.

**Mid-18th Century: German Sturm und Drang (Germany)**

In Germany, the late 1700s saw the rise of the Sturm und Drang movement, characterized by a focus on emotion, individualism, and nationalism. Poets like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller explored themes of time, memory, and human experience within the context of German identity and cultural heritage.

**Late 18th Century: French Revolution (France)**

The French Revolution (1789-1799) had a profound impact on French poetry. The emphasis shifted from classical forms to revolutionary ideals, with poets like Maximilien Robespierre and Louis Antoine de Saint-Just exploring themes of time, temporality, and the human condition within the context of social upheaval.

**Early 19th Century: Romanticism (France and Germany)**

The early 19th century saw a surge in Romantic poetry across both France and Germany. Poets like Victor Hugo and Alfred de Musset explored themes of time, nostalgia, and the sublime, while German Romantics like E.T.A. Hoffmann and Clemens Brentano delved into the mysteries of time and human experience.

**Mid-19th Century: Realism and Naturalism (France)**

In France, the mid-19th century saw a shift towards Realism and Naturalism, as poets like Gustave Courbet and Ã‰mile Zola explored themes of social realism, urbanization, and industrialization. This period also witnessed the rise of Baudelaire's Symbolist movement, which further complicated understandings of time and temporality.

**Late 19th Century: Decline and Reorientation (France)**

The late 1800s saw a decline in French poetry's focus on "Time and Temporality." The Dreyfus Affair and secularization debates led to a reorientation towards more contemporary themes, as poets like Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine explored the complexities of modern life.

**German Poetry: Unification and Nationalism**

In Germany, the late 19th century saw a surge in nationalistic sentiment, as poets like Heinrich Heine and Theodor Fontane explored themes of German identity, unification, and cultural heritage. The Wars of German Unification (1864-1871) also influenced poetry, with themes of time, memory, and human experience dominating the works of poets like Otto von Bismarck and Franz Liszt.

**Cross-National Influence**

Throughout this period, there was significant cross-national influence between French and German poetry. For example, the French Romantic movement had a profound impact on German Romantics, while the rise of Realism in France influenced German literary developments. This exchange contributed to the evolution of both countries' poetic traditions and their understandings of time and temporality.

**Conclusion**

The theme of "Time and Temporality" underwent significant changes across the 1700s and 1800s in French and German poetry. Periods of growth or decline were influenced by major historical, social, or cultural events, such as revolutions, wars, and cultural movements. As these trends evolved, they also intersected with one another, reflecting the complex interplay between artistic expression, intellectual shifts, and societal change.
