Look for me under the hood

of that old Chevrolet settled in weeds

at the end of the pasture.

I'm the radiator that spent its years

bolted in front of an engine

shoving me forward into the wind.

Whatever was in me in those days

has mostly leaked away,

but my cap's still screwed on tight

and I know the names of all these

tattered moths and broken grasshoppers

the rest of you've forgotten.

When I push your button

you fly off the handle,

old skin and bones,

black bat wing.

We're alike, you and I.

Both of us

resemble my mother,

so fierce in her advocacy

on behalf of

the most vulnerable child

who'll catch his death

in this tempest.

Such a headwind!

Sometimes it requires

all my strength

just to end a line.

But when the wind is at

my back, we're likely

to get carried away, and say

something we can never retract,

something saturated from the ribs

down, an old stony

word like ruin. You're what roof

I have, frail thing,

you're my argument

against the whole sky.

You're the fundamental difference

Is anything central?

Orchards flung out on the land,

Urban forests, rustic plantations, knee-high hills?

Are place names central?

Elm Grove, Adcock Corner, Story Book Farm?

As they concur with a rush at eye level

Beating themselves into eyes which have had enough

Thank you, no more thank you.

And they come on like scenery mingled with darkness

The damp plains, overgrown suburbs,

Places of known civic pride, of civil obscurity.

 

These are connected to my version of America

But the juice is elsewhere.

This morning as I walked out of your room

After breakfast crosshatched with

Backward and forward glances, backward into light,

Forward into unfamiliar light,

Was it our doing, and was it

The material, the lumber of life, or of lives

We were measuring, counting?

A mood soon to be forgotten

In crossed girders of light, cool downtown shadow

In this morning that has seized us again?

 

I know that I braid too much on my own

Snapped-off perceptions of things as they come to me.

They are private and always will be.

Where then are the private turns of event

Destined to bloom later like golden chimes

Released over a city from a highest tower?

The quirky things that happen to me, and I tell you,

And you know instantly what I mean?

What remote orchard reached by winding roads

Hides them? Where are these roots?

 

It is the lumps and trials

That tell us whether we shall be known

And whether our fate can be exemplary, like a star.

All the rest is waiting

For a letter that never arrives,

Day after day, the exasperation

Until finally you have ripped it open not knowing what it is,

The two envelope halves lying on a plate.

The message was wise, and seemingly

Dictated a long time ago, but its time has still

Not arrived, telling of danger, and the mostly limited

Steps that can be taken against danger

Now and in the future, in cool yards,

In quiet small houses in the country,

Our country, in fenced areas, in cool shady streets.

Hour in which I consider hydrangea, a salt or sand plant, varietal, the question of varietals, the diet of every mother I know, 5 pounds feels like 20, I have lost … I have lost, yes, a sense of my own possible beauty, grown external, I externalize beauty. Beauty occurs on the surface of plants; the sun darkens the skin of my child, he is so small, he is beautiful (I can see; it is obvious) and everything about him is beautiful. His hand swells from the bite [spread?] of some insect[’s] venom because he is small. He appears to feel nothing. He smashes his skull against the floor. He screams. I hold him in my lap on the kitchen floor in front of an open freezer, pressing a pack of frozen clay against his forehead. He likes the cold. I see; it is so obvious. Hydrangea. When I move, when I walk pushing my child’s stroller (it is both walking and pushing or hauling, sometimes, also, lifting; it is having another body, an adjunct body composed of errand and weight and tenderness and no small amount of power), I imagine I can feel this small amount of weight, this 5 pounds like 20, interfering with the twitch of every muscle in my body. As an object, a mother is confusing, a middle-aged mother with little spare flesh, I feel every inch of major muscle pulling against gravity and against the weight of my child, now sleeping. This is the hour for thinking hydrangea. Let no man look at me. I stop to brush the drowsy child’s little eye. His face. He barely considers his mother. I am all around him. Why should he consider what is all around him? Perhaps what is missing is a subtle power of differentiation. I am in, therefore, a time of mass apprehensions.

She couldn't help but sting my finger,

clinging a moment before I flung her

to the ground. Her gold is true, not the trick

evening light plays on my roses.

She curls into herself, stinger twitching,

gilt wings folded. Her whole life just a few weeks,

and my pain subsided in a moment.

In the cold, she hardly had her wits to buzz.

No warning from either of us:

she sleeping in the richness of those petals,

then the hand, my hand, cupping the bloom

in devastating force, crushing the petals for the scent.

And she mortally threatened, wholly unaware

that I do this daily, alone with the gold last light,

in what seems to me an act of love.

               I got a call from the White House, from the

President himself, asking me if I’d do him a personal

favor. I like the President, so I said, “Sure, Mr.

President, anything you like.” He said, “Just act

like nothing’s going on. Act normal. That would

mean the world to me. Can you do that, Leon?” “Why,

sure, Mr. President, you’ve got it. Normal, that’s

how I’m going to act. I won’t let on, even if I’m

tortured,” I said, immediately regretting that “tortured”

bit. He thanked me several times and hung up. I was

dying to tell someone that the President himself called

me, but I knew I couldn’t. The sudden pressure to

act normal was killing me. And what was going on

anyway. I didn’t know anything was going on. I

saw the President on TV yesterday. He was shaking

hands with a farmer. What if it wasn’t really a

farmer? I needed to buy some milk, but suddenly

I was afraid to go out. I checked what I had on.

I looked “normal” to me, but maybe I looked more

like I was trying to be normal. That’s pretty

suspicious. I opened the door and looked around.

What was going on? There was a car parked in front

of my car that I had never seen before, a car that

was trying to look normal, but I wasn’t fooled.

If you need milk, you have to get milk, otherwise

people will think something’s going on. I got into

my car and sped down the road. I could feel those

little radar guns popping behind every tree and bush,

but, apparently, they were under orders not to stop

me. I ran into Kirsten in the store. “Hey, what’s

going on, Leon?” she said. She had a very nice smile.

I hated to lie to her. “Nothing’s going on. Just

getting milk for my cat,” I said. “I didn’t know

you had a cat,” she said. “I meant to say coffee.

You’re right, I don’t have a cat. Sometimes I

refer to my coffee as my cat. It’s just a private

joke. Sorry,” I said. “Are you all right?” she

asked. “Nothing’s going on, Kirsten. I promise

you. Everything is normal. The President shook

hands with a farmer, a real farmer. Is that such

a big deal?” I said. “I saw that,” she said, “and

that man was definitely not a farmer.” “Yeah, I

know,” I said, feeling better.

About the only thing I thought I knew

was that nothing I’d ever know would do

any good. Sunrise, say, or that the part

of the horse’s hoof that most resembles

a human palm is called the frog;

certain chords on the guitar of no mercantile use;

the abstruse circuitry of an envelope

quatrain; even the meaning of horripilation.

 

Sometimes on a flatland mound the ancients had made,

I took heart in the pointlessness of stars

and lay there until my teeth chattered.

I earned my last Boy Scout merit badge

building a birdhouse out of license plates

manufactured by felons in the big house.

No more paramilitary organizations for me,

I said, ten years before I was drafted.

 

I had skills. Sure-footedness and slick

fielding. Eventually I would learn to unhook

a bra one-handed, practicing on my friend,

his sister's worn over his T-shirt (I took

my turns too). One Easter Sunday I hid

through the church service among the pipes

of the organ and still did not have faith,

although my ears rang until Monday.

 

I began to know that little worth knowing

was knowable and faith was delusion.

I began to believe I believed in believing

nothing I was supposed to believe in,

except the stars, which, like me,

were not significant, except for their light,

meaning I loved them for their pointlessness.

I believed I owned them somehow.

 

A C major 7th chord was beautiful and almost rare.

The horse I loved foundered and had to be

put down. The middle rhyme in an envelope

quatrain was not imprisoned if it was right.

In cold air a nipple horripilates

and rises, the sun comes up and up and up,

a star that bakes the eggs

in a Boy Scout license plate birdhouse.

 

God was in music and music was God.

A drill sergeant seized me by my dog tag

chain and threatened to beat me

to a pile of bloody guts for the peace sign

I’d chiseled in the first of my two tags,

the one he said they’d leave in my mouth

before they zipped the body bag closed.

Yet one more thing I’d come to know.

 

He also said that Uncle Sam owned my ass,

no more true than my ownership

of the stars. I can play a C major 7th chord

in five or six places on the neck of a guitar.

O the pain of peeling back the raw eyelids

to look for a lost word, and with lime

slaking in the veins, to hunt

for night herbs for a tribe of strangers!

 

The age. In the sick son’s blood the deposit of lime

is hardening. Moscow’s sleeping like a wooden coffin.

There’s no escaping the tyrant century.

After all these years the snow still smells of apples.

I want to run away from my own doorstep,

but where? Out in the street it’s dark,

and my conscience glitters ahead of me

like salt strewn on the pavement.

 

Somehow I’ve got myself set for a short journey

through the back lanes, past thatched eaves, starling houses,

an everyday passer-by, in a flimsy coat,

forever trying to button the lap-robe.

Street after street flashes past,

the frozen runners crunch like apples;

can’t get the button through the button-hole,

it keeps slipping out of my fingers.

 

The winter night thunders

like iron hardware through the Moscow streets.

Knocks like a frozen fish, or billows in steam,

flashing like a carp in a rosy tea-room.

Moscow is Moscow again. I say hello to her.

‘Don’t be stern with me; never mind.

I still respect the brotherhood

of the deep frost, and the pike’s justice.’

 

The pharmacy’s raspberry globe shines onto the snow.

Somewhere an Underwood typewriter’s rattled.

The sleigh-driver’s back, the snow knee-deep,

what more do you want? They won't touch you, won’t kill you.

Beautiful winter, and the goat sky

has crumbled into stars and is burning with milk.

And the lap-robe flaps and rings

like horse-hair against the frozen runners.

 

And the lanes smoked like kerosene stoves,

swallowed snow, raspberry, ice,

endlessly peeling, like a Soviet sonatina,

recalling nineteen-twenty.

The frost is smelling of apples again.

Could I ever betray to gossip-mongers

the great vow to the Fourth Estate

and oaths solemn enough for tears?

 

Who else will you kill? Who else will you worship?

What other lie will you dream up?

There’s the Underwood’s cartilage. Hurry, rip out a key,

you’ll find a little bone of a pike.

And in the sick son’s blood the deposit of lime

will melt, and there’ll be sudden blessèd laughter.

But the simple sonatina of typewriters

is only a faint shade of those great sonatas.

We spend the afternoon together watching a docudrama about wild horses that roamed the ancient Arctic Circle. Surprisingly sleek, built for speed and not the weather, they were remarkable for their recklessness. They careen headlong down ice bluffs to fall into a broken heap. We can hear the small, tinny sounds of their terror as they plunge across vast, glowing glacial faces. All of this takes place alongside an abstractly relentless gunmetal sea. I can feel you turn to me, wetness marking the corners of your lips and eyes. I, too, am mesmerized, my vision limited to a sense of motion on the peripheries. Later, I am summoned for an impromptu scan and, miraculously, I pass.

My skin crawls at odd hours of the day, a residual effect of my recent radiation therapies, how they inadvertently synced me to coronal flares. During my morning tea, at the gym, during the drive back home. A simple turn transforms into an avalanching pinprick of tremors one millimeter thick. I’d have preferred a suppurative response—one that collects under the skin—to this invisible, blistering, cracklesome lightning scar. One can’t choose the mood that gathers, the body’s response.

us fellow-feeling is finite in communities. Brotherly love becomes a

perception is the same; if the quantity of percepts, or our trove of eidetic

things, is not limitless but rather constant: the measure, say, of a sunlit

field. So if we dip like deep-sea divers to the world, we’ll have to use a

touches, and out of this a strange transformation:

Or, Don’t you wanna...I wanted to become something that was outside of the paradigms of expectation of the people in power.

The Skyview apartments

                    circa 1973, a boy is

kneeling on the rooftop, a boy who

                     (it is important

to mention here his skin

                    is brown) prepares his telescope,

the weights & rods,

                    to better see the moon. His neighbor

(it is important to mention here

                    that she is white) calls the police

because she suspects the brown boy

                    of something, she does not know

what at first, then turns,                    with her looking,

his telescope into a gun,

                    his duffel into a bag of objects

thieved from the neighbors’ houses

                     (maybe even hers) & the police

(it is important to mention

                    that statistically they

are also white) arrive to find

                    the boy who has been turned, by now,

into “the suspect,” on the roof

                    with a long, black lens, which is,

in the neighbor’s mind, a weapon &

somewhere quiet in your gut,

in the white space between lines 5 & 6,                    or maybe even earlier, & you might be holding

your breath for him right now

                    because you know this story,

it’s a true story, though,

of the story, anyway,

                    the boy on the roof of the Skyview lives

to tell the police that he is studying

                    the night & moon & lives

long enough to offer them (the cops) a view

                    through his telescope’s long, black eye, which,

if I am spelling it out anyway,

                    is the instrument he borrowed

& the beautiful “trouble” he went through

                    lugging it up to the roof

to better see the leopard body of

                    space speckled with stars & the moon far off,

much farther than (since I am spelling The Thing

                    out) the distance between

the white neighbor who cannot see the boy

                    who is her neighbor, who,

in fact, is much nearer

                    to her than to the moon, the boy who

wants to understand the large

                    & gloriously un-human mysteries of

the galaxy, the boy who, despite “America,”

                    has not been killed by the murderous jury of

his neighbor’s imagination & wound. This poem                    wants only the moon in its hair & the boy on the roof.

This boy on the roof of this poem

                    with a moon in his heart. Inside my own body

as I write this poem my body

                    is making a boy even as the radio

calls out the Missouri coroner’s news,

                    the Ohio coroner’s news.

2015. My boy will nod

                    for his milk & close his mouth around

the black eye of my nipple.

The boy. The cops. My body in this poem.

as the baby drinks & drinks them down

                    into the body that is his own, see it,

splayed & sighing as a star in my arms.                    Maybe he will be the boy who studies stars.

Maybe he will be (say it)

                    the boy on the coroner’s table

splayed & spangled

                    by an officer’s lead as if he, too, weren’t made

of a trillion glorious cells & sentences. Trying to last.

 

 

Leadless, remember? The body’s beginning,

splendored with breaths, turned,

by time, into, at least, this song.

 

This moment-made & the mackerel-“soul”

caught flashing inside the brief moment of the body’s net,

then, whoosh, back into the sea of space.

I wanted to give you something for your pain.

But not the drug du jour

or the kind word this side of cliché.

Something you wouldn’t find on a talk show,

in a department store or dark alleyway.

I wanted to give you something for your pain

 

but I couldn’t imagine what.

Frankincense, myrrh—even gold

seemed too plain (too plain and too gross).

I needed something that wouldn’t have occurred

to you or me, or even Nature: a creature

more fabulous, more imaginary

 

than you’d find in a rain forest or tapestry

or pixel-loaded screen. Some exotic anodyne

an alchemist or astrophysicist

would be envious of: a chemical reaction,

an astral refraction, an out-of-body,

out-of-mind, one-of-a-kind

 

transport from your pain, that would last

longer than a day, go deeper than the past.

I would have founded a whole new religion

if I thought that would suffice.

As for love—sacred, profane, or both—

I wanted to give you something

 

that didn’t arrive with a roll of the dice

and was hard to maintain and had a knack

for disappointing. I wanted to give you

something for your pain that didn’t smack

of a sorcerer’s trick, or a poet’s swoon,

or a psychiatrist’s quip. Nothing too heavy

 

or spacey or glib. I’d have given you the moon

but it’s been done (and besides, its desolate dust

and relentless tendency to wane

might have only exacerbated your pain).

If I could have given you something

you could depend on, could always trust

 

without a second thought, I would have.

A splendid view, perhaps, or a strain

of music. A favorite dish. A familiar tree.

A visit from a genie who, in lieu of granting you

a wish, would tend subtly to your every need,

and never once tire, never complain.

 

But when all was said and done

(or hardly said, not nearly done)

I was as helpless as you. Could you tell—

or were you so overcome your pain was all

that mattered? It seemed to me we were a kind

of kin: willing the mind its bold suspensions,

 

but the heart, once shattered, never quite matching

its old dimensions. And yet you persevered

in spite of pain, you knew to hold hope

as lightly as you held my hand (a phantom grasp,

a clasp that seemed to come from the other side).

And your genial smile made it plain: you were pleased

by my wish to please. And then you died.

                    The Orders

                ","

One spring night, at the end of my street

God was lying in wait.

 

A friend and I were sitting in his new sedan

like a couple of cops on surveillance,

shooting the breeze to pass the time,

chatting up the daydreams, the raw deals,

all the wouda-coulda-shoulda’s,

the latest “Can you believe that?”

As well as the little strokes of luck,

the so-called triumphs, small and unforeseen,

that kept us from cashing it all in.

 

And God, who’s famous for working

in mysterious ways and capable of anything,

took the form of a woman and a man,

each dressed in dark clothes and desperate enough

to walk up to the car and open the doors.

 

And God put a gun to the head of my friend—

right against the brain stem, where the orders go out

not only to the heart and the lungs

but to consciousness itself—a cold muzzle aimed

at where the oldest urges still have their day:

the one that says eat whatever’s at hand,

the one that wants only to fuck,

the one that will kill if it has to…

 

And God said not to look at him

or he’d blow us straight to kingdom come,

and God told us to keep our hands

to ourselves, as if she weren’t that kind of girl.

 

Suddenly time was nothing,

our lives were cheap, the light in the car

cold, light from a hospital,

light from a morgue. And the moments

that followed—if that’s what they were—

arrived with a nearly unbearable weight,

until we had acquired

a center of gravity

as great as the planet itself.

 

My friend could hardly speak—

he was too busy trying not to die—

which made me chatter all the more,

as if words, even the most ordinary ones,

had the power to return us to our lives.

 

And behind my ad-libbed incantation,

my counterspell to fear, the orders

still went out: keep beating, keep breathing,

you are not permitted to disappear,

 

even as one half of God kept bitching

to the other half that we didn’t have

hardly no money at all, and the other half barked,

“I’m telling you to shut your mouth!”

and went on rummaging through the back seat.

And no one at all looking out their window,

no one coming home or going out…

 

Until two tall neighbors came walking toward us

like unsuspecting saviors…  And God grabbed

the little we’d been given, the little we still had,

and hustled on to the next dark street.

And it won’t be multiple choice,

Neither will it be essay, which tempts us to run on

when we should be sticking to the point, if not together.

In the evening there shall be implications

our fear will change to complications. No cheating,

we’ll be told, and we’ll try to figure the cost of being true

to ourselves. In the evening when the sky has turned

that certain blue, blue of exam books, blue of no more

daily evasions, we shall climb the hill as the light empties

retired for the night, we shall stay up

and run back over the questions, each in our own way:

what’s true, what’s false, what unknown quantity

we did not fail.

There are those who will never return to us

visit our sleep, or daydreams, or turn up in the features

of total strangers. Or greet us face to face

you were just coming to love, who liked you close

no one else could provide. But was this the way

to do it? She didn’t know. She wanted me

to tell her. Tears down her face. And I kept driving.

I can look back and say: on that day, that’s when I died.

 

Since then, you and I have had a hard time believing

anything could bring us back. And yet your brown body

breathes new life into a cotton print from the fifties,

and picks parsley from the garden for spaghetti carbonara,

 

and cues up Mozart’s French horn solo, and fills up the kitchen

with the aroma of sourdough, and gets my body to anticipate

the taste of malt as the tops of American beer cans pop:

good rituals all, because they waited out our every loss, patient

with the slow coming back to our senses, undeterred by our neglect.

I have lived with animals. They kept me up all night.

Not only tom cats on the prowl, and neurotic rats

behind my baseboards, scratching out a slim existence.

There were cattle next door in the butcher’s pen,

great longhorns lowing in the dark. Their numbers had come up

and they knew it. I let their rough tongues lick my sorry palm.

Nothing else I could do for them, or they for me.

 

Walt can live with the animals. I’ll take these vegetables on parade:

string-beans and cabbage heads and pea brains, who negotiate

a busy crosswalk and feel brilliant, the smallest act accomplished

no mean feat, each one guiding them to other small acts

that will add up, in time, to something like steady purpose.

They cling to this fate, clutch it along with their brownbag lunches:

none of us would choose it, but this is their portion, this moment,

then this one, then the next. Little as it is, pitiful as it seems,

this is what they were given, and they don’t want to lose it.

 

The gawky and the slow, the motley and the misshapen…

What bliss to be walking in their midst as if I were one of them,

just ride this gentle wave of idiocy, forget those who profess

an interest in my welfare, look passing strangers in the eye

for something we might have in common, and be unconcerned if nothing’s there.

And now we peek into a dark café, and now we mug at the waitress

whose feet are sore, whose smile makes up for the tacky carnations

and white uniform makes it easy to mistake her for a nurse,

even makes it necessary, given the state of the world.

 

And when the giant with three teeth harangues us to hurry up,

what comfort to know he’s a friend, what pleasure to be agreeable,

small wonders of acquiescence, like obedient pets. Except animals

don’t have our comic hope, witless as it is. They don’t get

to wave madly at the waitress, as though conducting a symphony

of ecstatic expectations. If I turned and lived with animals

I’d only be a creature of habit, I’d go to where the food is

and the warmth. But I wouldn’t get to say to my troubled friend,

“Your eyes are so beautiful. I could live in them.”

Inside me lived a small donkey. I didn’t

walking. I over-thought it and couldn’t

the donkey finally hauled it out—

it looked shiny and new, a silver dollar—

and tossed it into a flock of birds

who had to fly a long way to find safety.

I knew then I was a large and dangerous man,

what with this donkey living inside me,

but felt futile. One day, during

a final lesson on breathing,

the donkey asked what kind of jeans

“Poor kid.” “So will you be staying on

I should be leaving soon. I think

and am considering, for a career, perpetual suffering.

The sun slides a tongue down the nape of the grain elevator.

Lowing cattle. It’s the fourth of July. In Spain.

I say, You are most vague and mysterious, friend.

The dog paces. I set my scythe aside and tell him,

I have employed this scythe mercilessly all my life and still

everywhere these stalks extend. He says,

Someone is always worse off than us

even at our most pitiable. Yes, I say. I read it once

in a magazine. And we laugh, let our enormous bellies jangle.

It is good to laugh with my friend and let the scythe cool, I say.

Yes, he says. Good.

                    Book Review: The Mountain Lion by Jean Stafford

                ","

Spoiler alert: in this all-but-forgotten

masterwork, Jean Stafford—who was once

widely regarded as the leading novelist

 

of her generation, and who wrote

this perverse, short,

lyrical novel, her second, during

 

the flailing failings

of her marriage to my hero

Robert Lowell—kills

 

Molly, her child-alter ego,

a girl too unloved and unloving

to survive puberty, too

 

pure and awful—like Stafford, who died

pickled and childish three

decades later after winning

 

the Pulitzer with her devastating,

hurtfully compassionate Collected Stories—for this or any other world,

 

especially the necessarily

allegorical one of fiction.

I am broken now, hopeless; hope

 

is proved by this book to be

a contrivance. I have just

read the last pages in which

 

Molly’s brother, Ralph—who,

to live, cannot love

either, has no spare love—shoots

 

her, aiming for the wild mountain

lion whose stuffed corpse

was to be the triumph

 

of his new manhood. I don’t

hate Ralph—how can I, a boy,

mistaken, like me? And can I hate

 

Molly, who so needed Ralph

and everyone, still young enough to savor

the bittersweet of her anger?

 

What about Stafford, who hurt

herself, all our selves, with

this ending, her classic tragedy, writing,

 

decades later, Poor old Molly! I loved her dearly and I hope she rests in peace.

 

Fuck insight and analysis:

my heart is shot. Why

did she have to die? Why does

 

anyone? Why do you, do I?

Because of what Ralph was

feeling just before he accidentally

 

slaughtered the future? This book

must have ravaged the already

sleepless poet Gregory Orr,

 

who shot his brother, too, and

suffers that endless error

in poetry and prose. And because Molly

 

refused everything, she stood between

Ralph and tomorrow. But he grew, he

changed. Confused? Read

 

the book. In novels

people die because of what they feel.

In life, people die when

 

their bodies conk out,

exhausted machines that living

expends. And what

 

happens when people feel

their feelings in life?

Nothing? Anything? Brenda,

 

dear Brenda, my love, nothing

happens, I’m afraid. I’m sorry. And afraid.

A small breeze born in the heart

 

gently bends a blade of grass

and no one hears a word.

No one reads Stafford anymore—I asked

 

on Facebook. Stafford died, her

legacy gently dispatched

into the low air. O, life

 

is terrible, literature

ridiculous. Stafford’s prose,

teeming and rich as loam,

 

could take Famous Franzen’s

for a walk, feed it biscuits.

But who cares? Who remembers?

 

O, to have been Jean Stafford,

in the past I idealize, when the world

was less self-conscious, less

 

precise. I could be

dead already, warmish

beneath a blanket of dust. Joyful

 

are the faded, the once-greats

whose afterlives slipped out

a hole in posterity's pocket:

 

they are loved poignantly by

a needy few. O, to be kept

cozy in the bosoms of those

 

desperate and proud, forgotten

for all the good I do. Love

is sunlight streaming unevenly

 

through the canopy of leaves

overhead. We can only grow

in the brighter patches below, fading

 

where light is thin. Molly,

we are with you, nowhere and gone.

Mostly we are forgotten, too.

on a backdrop of yellow. We speak of the abstract with wine in our mouths.

 

Meanwhile, in an antechamber, six are sequestered. They speak of mali-

cious intent, blood, evidence, testimony—murder versus manslaughter.

 

We arrive home to a throng of brown bodies, hands clutching red cups,

and music: its insistent treble stabbing the ears.

 

Inside, we slam all windows, but the music still blares as my niece shoots

people on the video game—its sounds are too realistic to bear.

 

Instead, the news, a verdict is in: not guilty. And everything is a blur

of sound, my heart beating so fast I put a hand to my chest.

 

I watch the TV screen: a collage of abstractions—spotlights, microphones,

smiles, handwritten signs. I stare, as if it were a painting—

 

a smear of twisted faces smothered in gesso and oil, a grid of red

on a backdrop of yellow—to make sense of.

 

The party continues. The 3-year-old probably in bed dreaming of melted

ice cream, and I am tired of partying.

 

There is a police station a half block away and I want it to burn. Instead,

only the smoke of weed, the meaningless music droning on,

 

the popping of balloons. Sunday morning, the birds are angry—their

chirping a noisy chant: NO NO NO NO. Outside, the rubbery flesh

 

of balloons color the driveway like splotches of paint. In an instant,

those still lives of heave and breath—gone in a pop.

boredom flanked by terror, a matter of keeping

low and not freezing. “You wore your helmet

in the rafters and thrived on ambush. We kept

 

our helmets on, my mother and I,

always tilted. He’d lump us with the ones

The god in me does not honor

the god in you. The god in you

murdered me once, and once

was more than enough.

So the god in me, adept

at keeping my nature warm

and inspired to love the benign,

now prefers the chilly air

of indifference, something picked up

like a virus from the most vicious

of mortals. The god in me

regards the god in you

as suspect, though sad

to say, it wasn’t always so.

There were the generous days

in the beginning, when every word

was made flesh. In the beginning

the gods in us were content

to let us go on

behaving like perfect mortals,

which is to say imperfectly,

which is to say with our tenderness

fully intact: the good kind

that let us gladly undress

our trepidations, and pleasure

our solitude into a blissful

oblivion; and the bad kind—

invisible woundings

no compliment or hot kiss,

no confession of the amorous

could soothe for long.

And then, when the mortals we were

had done enough to remind us

that to be mortal is to be susceptible

to the secret agenda, the cruel caprice,

the soft but eviscerating voice—

“at the mercy of a nuance”—

the god in you decided it was time

to act. A dark god, in need

of a human sacrifice, smoothly turning your back

on the earnest and their pathetic pleas.

So the god in me, no stranger to the aberrant

and the abhorrent, now has no choice

but to respond in kind. A pity, really,

since it has been the dream

of so many gods to find themselves

in some quiet room, the burden of power

slipped off and scattered

like clothes across the floor, the light

of late afternoon a kind of benediction,

and everywhere the gratitude

for the privilege of feeling

almost human.

as a flush of the toilet, when its swirling is a variation

 

on our sidereal drift, our existential pain.

in a widening gyre,” a portentous symbol of our own

circling into some dread, some pernicious chaos

we thought we had just escaped, one town burning

a decade behind us, a millennium before that,

brought me last night, calla lilies

and something else, I am not

sure what to call them, white flowers,

 

of course you had no way of knowing

it has been years since I bought

white flowers—but now you have

 

and here they are again. I was carrying

your flowers and a coffee cup

and a soft yellow handbag and a book

 

of poems by a Chinese poet, in

which I had just read the words “come

or go but don’t just stand there

 

in the doorway,” as usual I was

carrying too many things, you

would have laughed if you saw me.

 

It seemed especially important

not to spill the coffee as I usually

do, as I turned up the stairs,

 

inside the whorl of the house as if

I were walking up inside the lilies.

I do not know how to hold all

 

the beauty and sorrow of my life.

Three weeks until summer and then—what?

Midsummer’s gravity makes our heads spin

each hour a gilt thread spool, winding through

the second hand, gossamer fin de semaine,fin de siècle, fin slicing the water

of the too-cold-to-breathe bay, molten silver,

then receding as if we hadn’t seen it,

sultan of so long, see you tomorrow.

               Dead man’s fingers, lady’s slippers, a seal

who swims too close—too close for what? The needle

swerves. Our element chooses us. Water

fire, air, earth—the rosebush, Lazarus,

hot to the touch, gold reticulate, is love’s

bull’s-eye, attar rising from the rafters.

If I could make it stop I would. Was it

the crocodile Hook feared, or was it time?

The hour’s arrow never misses, the gnomon,

glinting, cuts the Day-Glo sun to pieces.

In the ultraviolet palace of the Mermaid King

his girls wear scallop shells, one for each year

on their turquoise tails. Even they have birthdays,

why not you? Death, hold your ponies with one

hand, and stay awhile. On my desk, the lion’s

paw lamps scavenged from the winter beach,

its poppy-colored shells like the lit scales

of an enormous Trojan fish … teeth chattering,

its metronome time bomb tsk tsk—

when is giving up not giving in?

When Alice pulled the stopper, did she get

smaller, or did the world get larger? In

the bath, your nose bleeds a bouquet of tissue

roses, white stained red—adolescence

is to overdo it, but really? Thirty

stories up, our birds’-eye view is

the hummingbird tattoo on your bare head,

wings beating, too tiny and too big to see,

your wire-thin profile drawn upright, bones

               daring the air, marionette running on

the brain’s dark marrow, tungsten for the fireflies’

freeze tag. Due south, the Chrysler Building’s gauntlet

holds a lit syringe. We do and do not change.

Let me go from here to anywhere.

That’s it for now. And so we turn the page

your poems standing in for you, or—that’s

not it, what’s left of you, mediating

between what you’d call mind and body

and I, by now biting my lip, call grief,

               the lines netting the enormous air

like silver threads, the tails of Mr. Edwards’s

spiders with which they sail from ledge to branch

“as when the soul feels jarred by nervous thoughts

and catch on air.” Pace. Your trousers worn

to mouse fur dragging on the stoop, your hip

prongs barely holding them aloft, the past

a phaeton, its sunlit reins bucking

at before and after, but there is no after.

 

 

V

 

Or is there? For once, when you rock back

on the chair I don’t say don’t do that,

forelegs lifting, hooves pawing the air—

Every departure’s an elopement,

the shy cat fiddling while Rome sizzles,

spoon mirror flipping us upside down.

               Son of Helios, rainbow fairy lights

blazing, when one light goes out they all

go out. At the top of the dune, the thorny

crowns of buried trees, their teeter-totter

branches a candelabra for the spiders’

silvery halo of threads. What a terrible

business it is, saying what you mean.

               Speak, sky, the horizon scored by talons.

At the high school football game, the boys

stroke their new muscles, the girls sweeten their lips

with gloss that smells of bubblegum, candy cane,

or cinnamon. In pleated cheerleader skirts

they walk home with each other, practicing yells,

their long bare legs forming in the dark.

Under the arched field lights a girl

in a velvet prom dress stands near the chainlink,

a cone of roses held between her breasts.

Her lanky father, in a corduroy suit, leans

against the fence. While they talk, she slips a foot

in and out of a new white pump, fingers the weave

of her French braid, the glittering earrings.

They could be a couple on their first date, she,

a little shy, he, trying to impress her

with his casual stance. This is the moment

when she learns what she will love: a warm night,

the feel of nylon between her thighs, the fine hairs

on her arms lifting when a breeze

sifts in through the bleachers, cars

igniting their engines, a man bending over her,

smelling the flowers pressed against her neck.

You will leave your home:

nothing will hold you.

You will wear dresses of gold; skins

of silver, copper, and bronze.

The sky above you will shift in meaning

each time you think you understand.

You will spend a lifetime chipping away layers

of flesh. The shadow of your scales

will always remain. You will be marked

by sulphur and salt.

You will bathe endlessly in clear streams and fail

to rid yourself of that scent.

Your feet will never be your own.

Stone will be your path.

Storms will follow in your wake,

destroying all those who take you in.

You will desert your children

kill your lovers and devour their flesh.

You will love no one

but the wind and ache of your bones.

Neither will love you in return.

With age, your hair will grow matted and dull,

your skin will gape and hang in long folds,

your eyes will cease to shine.

But nothing will be enough.

The sea will never take you back.

The cat has the chance to make the sunlight

Beautiful, to stop it and turn it immediately

Into black fur and motion, to take it

As shifting branch and brown feather

Into the back of the brain forever.

The cardinal has flown the sun in red

Through the oak forest to the lawn.

The finch has caught it in yellow

And taken it among the thorns. By the spider

It has been bound tightly and tied

In an eight-stringed knot.

The sun has been intercepted in its one

Basic state and changed to a million varieties

Of green stick and tassel. It has been broken

Into pieces by glass rings, by mist

Over the river. Its heat

Has been given the board fence for body,

The desert rock for fact. On winter hills

It has been laid down in white like a martyr.

This afternoon we could spread gold scarves

Clear across the field and say in truth,

""Sun you are silk.""

Imagine the sun totally isolated,

Its brightness shot in continuous streaks straight out

Into the black, never arrested,

Never once being made light.

Someone should take note

Of how the earth has saved the sun from oblivion.

The leaden black receiver did not talk.

My uncle never gave his name or town,

The earpiece roar dissolved to crackling sounds,

a dial tone erased the Philippines.

And yet my world grows huge with maps, crisscrossed,

my History alive with all I've lost.

Not, in the saying of you, are you

said. Baffled and like a root

stopped by a stone you turn back questioning

being at one time what was to be said

the saying of you remains the living of you

never to be said. But, enduring,

you change with the change that changes

Ever yourself, you are always about
